# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project uses semantic versioning. Only the latest non-preview version is supported. Preview versions are provided as-is.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use Issues to report security vulnerability. If you feel that the vulnerability needs to be disclosed privately, contact michal.valasek@altairis.cz.

Please note: this is an open source project with single maintainer. I try to handle all requests in timely fashion, but can't provide any guarantees.
