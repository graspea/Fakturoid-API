# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project uses semantic versioning. Only the latest non-preview version is supported. Preview versions are provided as-is.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use Issues to report security vulnerability. If you feel that the vulnerability needs to be disclosed privately, use channels described at [my homepage](https://www.rider.cz/#contact).

## Expected timeframes

This is an open source project with single maintainer. I try to handle all requests in timely fashion, but can't provide any guarantees.
